# Labs
Professional Development space with scalable structure for demonstrating skill-building across technology domains


## Purpose

This repository serves as an ongoing hands-on engineering lab to maintain and expand practical depth across security, systems, networking, and development disciplines.

The focus is on building small, functional prototypes and experiments that reinforce detection engineering, identity security, log analysis, and automation patterns.
